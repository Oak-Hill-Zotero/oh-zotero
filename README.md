# oh-zotero
A Zotero stylesheet based on SoBL2 adapted to match the Oak Hill College assignment guidlines.
## Guidelines for contributing
We are using GitHub for hosting this project as it allows us to collaborate easily. Git will clearly show us changes made to the stylesheet and also allow us to track updates. Don't worry if you haven't used git before, it's easy to learn and a useful skill.
Before starting, you will need to have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer and I find it helpful to install [GitHub desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop/) so I dont' have to use the command line.

### Procedure for working on the stylesheet
