# oh-zotero
A Zotero stylesheet based on SoBL2 adapted to match the Oak Hill College assignment guidlines.
## Guidelines for contributing
We are using GitHub for hosting this project as it allows us to collaborate easily. Git will clearly show us changes made to the stylesheet and also allow us to track updates. Don't worry if you haven't used git before, it's easy to learn and a useful skill.
Before starting, you will need to have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer and I find it helpful to install [GitHub desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop/) so I don't have to use the command line.

### Procedure for working on the stylesheet
1. If you don't have one, create yourself a GitHub account.
1. Fork this repository using the button in the top right corner. This will add the repository to your GitHub account.
1. Sync with git on your computer.
1. Make your edit (if it's a complex edit then create a branch so it can be worked on collaboratively apart from the master branch).
1. Test your edit.
1. Commit your edit. Please use a helpful commit title which will mean something to others. If your edit fixes an issue listed in the GitHub repository, please reference it in your commit using e.g. `#4` to reference Issue 4.
1. Sync with GitHub.
1. On GitHub, create a Pull Request on the main repository requesting that your edit be pulled in.
1. Your edit will be considered by other members and if accepted it will be merged into the main repository by an admin. Or, suggestions for improvements might be made to be completely before merging.

### Procedure for sharing updated stylesheet with student community
1. Version number is increased in stylesheet file and committed.
1. A new release with matching version number is made on GitHub in the @Oak-Hill-Zotero repository.
1. The updated stylesheet is added to the bottom of the [vle page](https://sites.google.com/a/oakhill.ac.uk/student-pages/study-resources/study-software/bibliography-tools/bibliography-zotero).
1. Interested students are notified of update. (it might be worth creating a Hangout Group for this)
